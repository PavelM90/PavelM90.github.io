## Biography
My name is Pavel, and I am a professional in Analytical Sciences with a robust background as a trained chemical engineer.
Over the years, I have worked with various types of molecules, including proteins, RNA, DNA, and lipids.
I have developed numerous methods for analyzing protein and RNA structures, authored standard operating procedures (SOPs), and trained personnel in these areas. My expertise lies in structural elucidation, where I have gained in-depth knowledge. 

In 2018, I had the distinction of being the first person to develop a method and analyze the first clinical material at VIR Biotechnology.

Later, in 2020, I was on the front lines at Moderna, contributing to the fight against COVID-19.

Several years ago, I became interested in Data Science and machine learning. For the past three years, I have been focusing on incorporating Data Science into analytical sciences, working on multiple projects to automate data processing. I recently graduated from Bellevue University with a Master’s in Data Science. 
During my studies, I worked on several projects related to breast cancer classification and recognition. 

I possess a solid understanding of machine learning algorithms, including linear and logistic regression, decision trees, and neural networks. Recently, I have become interested in working with visual data types. 
My strong communication and presentation skills, coupled with my enjoyment of teamwork, make me an effective collaborator. 

I enjoy playing soccer, playing video games, producing electronic music and DJing, building computers, and walking with my dog in my spare time.
